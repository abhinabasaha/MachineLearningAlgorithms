# Machine Learning Algorithms

In this repository I am sharing my survey on various **Machine Learning(ML) Algorithms** and **statistical models** and their use cases.

###                                         Classification of ML algorithms

#### Regression
1. Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR)
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Stepwise Regression
5. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
6. Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)
7. Jackknife Regression

#### Regularization
